* How does the emulator work

** spin_emu_main.c
Entry point of the emulator, we read a config file

It calls spin_emu_dispatcher

*** spin_emu_dispatcher(2, x, y)

x and y are read from config file and are the number of chips ? 

"spin_emu_dispatcher() listens to ybug command packets and routes packets
between core processes"

First these two are called:
bind_ethernet_channel() -> creates a scoket to receive commands

This creates and end point for receiving and sendign data in a computer network 

**** TODO search more on this socket thing 


iptag_init () -> steup IP tags 
**** TODO check IP protocol


then *cmd_p2pc* is called which starts the number of CPUs(chips) to emulate.
This also initialize the routing table spin_emu_routes.


main loop while(1){ ... } ->

at each iteration in the loop we have multiple file descriptors in fd_set fds

FD_ZERO(&fds) clears the set (what does that mean?)

FD_SET(spin_emu_ether_fd, &fds) add file descriptor spin_emu_ether_fd to set 

a file descriptor is just a unique identifier (a number) for a file or I/O resource

If FD_ISSET(...) then we receive messages from ethernet

receive_msg_from_ether() ->
